// Q#14 == Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

// var myGuest = [
//   'Danial sir',
//   'Zeeshan Sir',
//   'Adeel Sir',
//   'Zia Sir',
//   'Heera madam',
// ];

// for (let i = 0; i <= myGuest.length - 1; i++) {
//   console.log('Hi, You are coordially invited to dinner with me ' + myGuest[i]);
// }
