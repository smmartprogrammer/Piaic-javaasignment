// Qno 32: Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
// • Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
// • Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.
// • Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.
// • Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.

const current_users = ['John', 'Alex', 'Anna', 'Candra', 'Martin', 'Roman'];
const new_users = ['john', 'Alex', 'kicker', 'shownmacel', 'bigshow', 'Roman'];

for (let i = 0; i < new_users.length; i++) {
  if (new_users[i].includes(current_users[i].toLowerCase())) {
    console.log(current_users[i], 'is already used');
  } else {
    console.log(current_users[i], 'is avaliable');
  }
}
