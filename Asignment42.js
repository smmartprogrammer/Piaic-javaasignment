// Qno 42: Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

let magicians = ['Lance Burton', 'Ricky Jay', 'Mark Wilson', 'Harry Anderson'];

function show_magicians(magicians) {
  make_great(magicians);
}

function make_great(magicians) {
  for (magicians of magicians) {
    console.log(`${magicians} is a great magician`);
  }
}
show_magicians(magicians);
